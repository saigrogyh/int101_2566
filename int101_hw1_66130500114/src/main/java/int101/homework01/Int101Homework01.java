          4.1.2 a public constructor that receives 
                an "id" parameter to set the "id" field.
          4.1.3 public getter/setter methods.
          4.1.4 @Override a public "toString" method that 
                returns a "String" of value "Person(id)" 
                where "id" is the "id" field.
      4.2 Create a public class named "BankAccount" in package named "work04".
          This class contains the following field and methods.
          4.2.1 a private "number" field of type "int".
          4.2.1 a private "owner" field of type "Person".
          4.2.2 a private "balance" field of type "double".
          4.2.3 a public constructor that receives a "number" parameter and

          4.2.4 public getter methods for "owner" and "balance" fields.
          4.2.5 a public "deposit" method that receives an "amount" 
                parameter of type "double" and returns a "double". 
                This method adds the "amount" to the "balance" to set
                the new value of the "balance" and returns this new value.
